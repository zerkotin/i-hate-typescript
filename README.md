# i-hate-typescript

ill start by saying - this is my oppinion - whether you like it or not - it remains.

## ive been using it for 2 years now
not by choice of course - it was a company decision - which im very much against.
let me say that the typing idea is not all bad - it has its perks - especially when it comes to API and code completion.
it makes life easy in some cases - and i will argue that i would have used typing to some small degree.

but! with that said - with no doubt whatsoever i would take javascript with no typing everyday.

## why do people use typescript
i think that the people who prefer typescript over javascript did not takke the time to grow on it and get used to a functional programming way.

they probably come from OO world (although i did too - but that was long ago) and cant get used to flexibility of the language. it must be scary i get it i was there, but i took the time and after many years of javascript i find it beautiful.

## how it feels to use typescript
whenever i use typescript i cant help but feel suffucated and castrated. 
clean code - forget it - it looks so ugly.
my hands want to smack the keyboard everytime i need to write a type for something that is so obvious!!!
or write something just for the compiler to accept it.
or write a function to make sure types are correct - seriously this is the worse.

## typeguards - the most horrible invention of typescript
typeguards are typescripts way of making sure a type is enforced and casted correctly.
a typeguard is a function! now - i could accept a function like that if it was for compiling only and then removed by the compiler - but those functions actually pass down to the javascript and are used.

## performance
using typescript requires
1. extra code for typing and satisfying the compiler
2. extra functions just for typing
3. it encourages OO style of writing - which in turn causes many classes to be created with no reason - which leads to more memory consumption.

you might argue about the last point - if you have good programmers it wont happen right? wrong - it happens time and time again, years of experience tought me differently.

## what is the main argument for typescript?
its better to have typing when working in large groups.

sorry - its better to have good javascript developers rather than java developers that try to do frontend in typescript.

# what do i offer? BEST PRACTICES and TIME
take the time to know the language intimately - embrace its flexibility.
most important!

Javascript has a huge community - there are BEST PRACTICES - take time to learn them.
this is usually the main problem.
people dont know how to approach a certain problem and "just do".

think and learn before you "just do" and i assure you - you wont need typescript.


## summary
i hate typescript is a bit harsh - i dont like it for many reasons - mostly because i like my clean javascript code and i see typescript more as a disturbance rather than helpful. sure types can be nice sometimes - but for the very little times where i would have liked types - typescript is an overkill which requires more than i wish to sacrifice.

typescript can be used mildly - but from my experience developers mostly abuse the code with overtyping everyhing possible.
it looks bad, its not performant - i have nothing more to add.
